1. VPC peering.
    How to do it practically.
    Does it only needs configuring the SG or does it also needs additional setting changes like route tables.
    What is the procedure 
    Practical application.
    mumbai region: 1 public 1 private, 
    Ireland: 2 private instances.

    objective:
        1. ssh from mumbai-public (jump server) to mumbai-private (db server)
        2. ssh from mumbai-private to Ireland-private using vpc peering.


2. Weighted routing.
    How to acheive this.
        Ans: create 2 records with same record name and alias to different LBs(with two different websites) and change the weightage to 100 and 0. 
             access the record-name in broswer, shift the weights and you should see the chnage in the website being accessed.

    Do we need to uses two different records with same name with alias to LB or do we need to use a single record!!!
        Ans: Yes we need to create two records with same name.

    Even after changing the weightage to the records ( one with 100 and other to 0), why cannot I see the changes when i used the same donamin/record-name in the browser.
        Ans: Reason1: It will be because of the TTL, chnage it to very mini like 5 sec.
             REason2: It amy be because of the browser we are using. The request may go to chache in the local machine's browser first rathe rather than actual website.
                      So better to use Incognito mode while accessing the website through record-name.
