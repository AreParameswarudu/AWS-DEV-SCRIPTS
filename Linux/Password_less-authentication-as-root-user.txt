lets see how we do PASSWORDLESS connection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	launch a ec2 instance ( with AL2 and t2.micro is fine ) for   master server.
	and a similar for slave server

	connect to them using mobaxterm.
	set hostname for them as master and slave ( to reduce confusion )
	
	use MULTI-execution to set password simultaneously.
		1. Add root password to all machines
			> passwd root 
				the add password

		2. Enable all server to login as root
			> vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
				go to line 33
				PermitRootLogin yes	--> uncomment this
				go to 61 
				PasswordAuthentication yes --> uncomment this
					NOTE! if passwword authentication in the next line is no then comment it
	
		3. Restart ssh  to reflect the changes 
			> systemctl restart sshd
			see the status   
			> systemctl status sshd
	
		exit from multi-execution mode

	In master, 
		4. Go to root dir     
		> cd ~
		Generate keys	
		> ssh-keygen 
			enter ---> enter  --> key will be generated.
		
		5. Save this password in the slave server.
			>  ssh-cpoy-id root@ip-of-slave   
				--> yes    ---> asks password --> enter the password that we set previous


		Now we can use ssh to slave without password.
		> ssh root@ip-of-slave.
