lets see how we do PASSWORDLESS connection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	launch a ec2 instance ( with AL2 and t2.micro is fine ) for   master server.
	and a similar for slave server

	connect to them using mobaxterm.
	set hostname for them as master and slave ( to reduce confusion )
	
	use MULTI-execution to set password simultaneously.
		command	:   passwd root  ---> the add password

		enable all server to login as root
		command	: vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		go to line 33
		permitlogin to yes
		go to 61 
		password authentication yes
	
		restart ssh  --> command:		systemctl restart sshd
		see the status   --> command	: 	

	exit from multi-execution mode

	In master, 
		go to root dir     --> cd ~
		generate keys	---> command :    ssh-keygen --> enter ---> enter   --> key will be generated.
		
		save this password in the slave server.--> 
			command: ssh-cpoy-id root@ip-of-slave   --> yes    ---> asks password


		now we can use ssh to slave without password.
		command: ssh root@ip-of-slave.
